# CIS275-C

Coding Assignments for CIS270

Console applications created as exercises in using basic programming principles, written in C# in Visual Studio IDE

Week 1 Lab:	Various applications to perform simple functions such as finding area of a rectangle, summing integers, demonstrating using the console for input
			and output.
			
Week 2 Lab:	This application will generate a table of numbers from 1 to 256 and the equivalent values in hexadecimal, octal, and binary.  Demonstrates 
			use of while loops and switch case statements.
			
Week 3 Lab:	Exercise in using arrays:  This program defines a set of arrays containing various details of items in inventory at a gas station.  The user can 
			select to display the details of a particular item or of all the items.
			
Week 4 Lab:	This application demonstrates the use of abstract data type "RetailItem" by creating objects using each of the available constructors, using the 
			class' mutator functions to set values of the properties, and using the ItemDisplay member function to format the ojects for output.
			
Week 5 Lab:	This application is an exercise in using methods and properties to simulate the operation of a virtual toaster oven.

Week 6 Lab:	This application is an exercise in object inheritance demonstrated by modelling a toaster oven, electric toothbrush, and can opener derived from	
			an "appliance" base class

Week 7 Lab:	This application is an exercise in file input/output.
